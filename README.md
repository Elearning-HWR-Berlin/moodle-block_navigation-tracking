# Navigation Tracking Moodle Plugin

## Description
The Navigation Tracking block plugin for Moodle improves course navigation with a better usability/ user experience by:
* aggregating all topics and activities/resources of one course (order mirrored from course)
* making the topics collapsible with the 'active' topic opened on page load
* indicating topic progress and completion of individual activities/ resources (green = completed; blank background = not started; bold text & light grey = in progress)
* adding icons for activities/ resources to indicate the type of activity/ resource


## Credits

The plugin was developed by [Synergy Learning](http://www.synergy-learning.com) based on a concept by [Bj√∂rn Lefers](http://www.lefers.com) as part of his work in a project team that developed a [blended learning degree program in Business Adminstration at HWR Berlin](http://www.hwr-berlin.de/fachbereich-wirtschaftswissenschaften/studiengaenge/business-administration-ba/blended-learning-format/). 

## Version

The plugin is released under [GNU GPL v3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). It has been tested and is running on Moodle version 3.3. at HWR Berlin (it has not, yet, been tested for Moodle versions 3.4./ 3.5., but we are planning to do so in August/September 2018). 

Please be aware that the plugin was designed to match the [Lambda Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/lambda-responsive-moodle-theme/9442816), which is not available for free.
